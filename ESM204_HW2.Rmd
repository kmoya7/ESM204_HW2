```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r cars}
# read in data
water_districts <-read_csv(here("water_districts.csv"))
```

```{r}
# plot each irrigation district, plot the marginal 
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(Reduction ~ MC_Kern, data = water_districts)

cor(water_districts$MC_Kern, water_districts$Reduction)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
